 <div class="howitworks">

   <h2>How it works</h2>



   <p>LED face masks use non-invasive light therapy to activate the skinâ€™s natural healing processes, making them suitable for at-home use. They typically involve wearing the mask for 10-30 minutes, a few times a week, depending on the skin issue you're targeting.

     While results can vary based on skin type and concerns, many users report seeing improvements in their skin texture, clarity, and tone with consistent use. However, it's important to note that LED light therapy isn't a quick fix and works best when used alongside a good skincare routine</p>
